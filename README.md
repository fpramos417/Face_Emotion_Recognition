Considering the listed scenarios above, we can conclude that different industries can take advantage of a model that recognizes face emotions.

The intended goal is to recognize the emotions a person feeling. Even though humans have a wide range of emotions, in this case, we are only using four categories happy, sad, neutral, and surprised.

We are using data science to build the best performing model that will help us determine whether a person is feeling happy, sad, neutral, or suprised. Data science is helping us in this task because it reads thousands of images that have already being labeled and extracts its features.

## About the dataset

The data set consists of 3 folders, i.e., 'test', 'train', and 'validation'.
Each of these folders has four subfolders:

**‘happy’**: Images of people who have happy facial expressions.
**‘sad’**: Images of people with sad or upset facial expressions.
**‘surprise’**: Images of people who have shocked or surprised facial expressions.
**‘neutral’**: Images of people showing no prominent emotion in their facial expression at all.
